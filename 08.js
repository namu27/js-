//State the difference between = =and = ==.//

Ans /*   "==" checks only for equality in value whereas 

          "===" is a stricter equality test and returns false 

          if either    the value or the type of the two variables are different.

          So, the second option needs both the value and the type 

          to be the same for the operands    */
